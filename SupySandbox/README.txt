SupySandbox provides a safe way to allow everybody to run Python code from IRC
thanks to haypo's pysandbox.

SupySandbox also aims to provide a powerful safe (i.e. anyone can run code
without lateral effect on the bot or the host computer) scripting language,
but it is blocked by technical problems.
